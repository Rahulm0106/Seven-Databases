# Seven-Databases
This repository contains all of the code examples and exercises from the book of the same name, which serves as a guide to modern databases and the NoSQL movement. Inside, you'll find the code for working with seven different databases: Redis, DynamoDB, Neo4j, MongoDB, CouchDB, HBase, and Postgres.
